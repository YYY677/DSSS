        "### What is YOLOv5\n",
        "Object detection is a fairly complicated task, and there are a number of different approaches to it. In this tutorial, we’ll be using a model called YOLOv5. YOLO stands for **You Only Look Once**, and it’s a model that was developed by [Joseph Redmon et al.](https://pjreddie.com/), and the full paper detailing the model can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640).\n",
        "\n",
        "The YOLOv5 model is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a type of deep learning model. CNNs are very good at identifying patterns in images, particularly in small regions of images. This is important for object detection, because we want to be able to identify objects even if they’re partially obscured by other objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "YOLO works by chopping an image up into a grid, and then predicting the location and size of objects in each grid cell:\n",
        "\n",
        "![](https://bellingcat.github.io/RS4OSINT/images/yolo.jpg)\n",
        "\n",
        "It learns the locations of these objects by training on a dataset of images in which each object is indicated by a bounding box. Then, when it’s shown a new image, it will attempt to predict bounding boxes around the objects in that image. The standard YOLO model is trained on the COCO dataset, which contains over 200,000 images of 80 different objects ranging from people to cars to dogs. YOLO models pre-trained on this dataset work great out of the box to detect objects in videos, photographs, and live streams. But the nature of the objects we’re interested in is a bit different.\n",
        "\n",
        "Luckily, we can simply **re-train** the YOLOv5 model on datasets of labeled satellite imagery. We will walk through the process of re-training YOLOv5 on a custom dataset, and then using it to identify objects in satellite imagery pulled from Google Earth Engine or Google Map."
